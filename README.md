# Object

manipulating object? Nah, thats eazy!

This includes type-checking at runtime, so when you compare these objects, you are very VERY safe!

## Current changelog

BREAKING CHANGE when migrating from @cupglassdev/object. `refCompare` was
renamed to `compareRef`

## Installing

You can install this in Node! (Yes, without transpilling) By running

```shell
$ npx jsr add @dunno/object
```

Or in Yarn

```shell
$ yarn dlx jsr add @dunno/object
```

Or in pnpm

```shell
$ pnpm dlx jsr add @dunno/object
```

---

Or in Deno (they provide their built in JSR system, so just do this)

```shell
$ deno add jsr:@dunno/object
```

Or in Bun

```shell
$ bunx jsr add @dunno/object
```

## Importing

By default, the module dosent have a default export. You can do it like this

```js
import * as obj from "@dunno/object";
```

Or for [Deno](https://deno.com) users

```js
import * as obj from "jsr:@dunno/object";
```

## Example

#### Compare same non-primitive reference

```js
import * as obj from "@dunno/object";
// This is our reference one
const helloArray = ["Hello"];
// This variable just re-forwards the reference one
const hiArray = helloArray;
// The output should be `true`
console.log(obj.compareRef(helloArray, hiArray));
```

#### Compare diffrent non-primitive reference

```js
import * as obj from "@dunno/object";
// This is our reference one
const helloArray = ["Hello"];
/*
This is our reference two
(because it dosent re-forward reference one
like we do in the first example)
*/
const hiArray = ["Hello"];
/*
The output should be `false`.
Even though the value are exactly same
*/
console.log(obj.compareRef(helloArray, hiArray));
```

#### Detect if array was a normal array

```js
import * as obj from "@dunno/object";
// make a new, normal array
const test = ["Hello"];
/*
 The output should be `true`,
 because its using the normal Array class
*/
console.log(obj.isLiteralArray(test));
// The output should be `false`
console.log(obj.isExtendedArray(test));
```

#### Detect if array was an extended array class (Int16Array, or such)

```js
import * as obj from "@dunno/object";
// make a new Int16Array
const test = new Int16Array([8]);
// The output should be `false`
console.log(obj.isLiteralArray(test));
/*
 The output should be `true`,
 because its not a standard array class
*/
console.log(obj.isExtendedArray(test));
```
